# PKULayer

This is a naive tool to generating and uploading mock running track in PKURunner. Sine the PKURunner app is not stable, I don't guarantee fully availability in long term. GPXPY and requests is required.

## Installation
Download it, run it.

*Only if you have the libraries installed.*

TODO: submit it to pypy
## Usage
Run the script and input the values it requires.

For advanced users, you can modify the code as you like. You can see the url captured from Charles.

## Credits
I hold the view that everyone should have the right that he choose where and when to run as his wish.
